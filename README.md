To get started with this project, you'll first need to either create your own MySQL database or provide the login credentials for an existing database. You'll also need to provide the name of the database you want to use.

Once you have the necessary information, you can clone this repository and open the crud_operations.py file in your Python editor of choice. You'll need to install the mysql-connector-python library using pip install mysql-connector-python in your command prompt or terminal.

Next, replace the placeholder values in the config dictionary with your own MySQL database information. You'll need to replace the user and password values with your own login credentials, and the database value with the name of your database.
